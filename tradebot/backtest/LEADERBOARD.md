# Leaderboard (SLV, 1 hour, 2025-07-02 -> 2026-01-02)

This file captures **top-performing grid combos** from offline sweeps.

**Sweep assumptions (important):**
- Offline cached bars only (`use_rth=False`)
- Starting cash: `$10,000` (capital constrained)
- **Max-potential mode**: `max_entries_per_day=0`, `open_position_cap=0` (stacking allowed subject to cash/margin)
- Equity option multiplier assumed `100` (PnL shown is approx USD)
- Multi-leg fills use a **single combo bid/ask edge** (not leg-by-leg).
- Flip-exit (when enabled): `min_hold_bars=6`, `only_if_profit=true`

**Global grid:**
- `dte`: [0, 5, 10, 20]
- `ema_preset`: ['3/7', '9/21', '20/50']
- `exit_on_signal_flip`: [False, True]
- `flip_exit_min_hold_bars`: [6]
- `flip_exit_only_if_profit`: [True]
- `min_trades`: 8
- `moneyness_pct`: [1.0, 2.0]
- `profit_target`: [0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0, 50.0, 100.0, 200.0]
- `stop_loss`: [0.35, 0.8, 1.0]
