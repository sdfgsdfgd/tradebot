# Backtest Engine (Synthetic Options)

This package provides a minimal backtest runner that builds **synthetic option prices** from underlying bars and evaluates a single strategy per run. The code is structured to be reusable for a future live trading engine.

## What it does
- Pulls **hourly underlying bars** via IBKR and caches them on disk.
- Builds **synthetic option chains** using EWMA realized volatility + skew.
- Prices options with **Black-76** (futures) or **Black-Scholes** (equities).
- Simulates credit spreads with **mid-edge** entry/exit fills.
- Outputs **CLI summary** and CSVs (`trades.csv`, `equity_curve.csv`).

## Usage
```bash
python -m tradebot.backtest --config backtest.sample.json
```

Use `--no-write` to skip CSV output. Add `--calibrate` to refresh the synthetic calibration using delayed LAST quotes.

## Cache layout
Bars are cached under `db/` (configurable):
```
db/<SYMBOL>/<SYMBOL>_<start>_<end>_<bar>_<rth|full>.csv
```
This cache is designed to be shared later with the live trading engine.

## Config (JSON)
See `backtest.sample.json`. Core fields:

### backtest
- `start`, `end` (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `bar_size` (e.g. `1 hour`)
- `use_rth` (true = RTH, false = full session)
- `starting_cash`
- `risk_free_rate` (fixed; TODO: load historical rates)
- `cache_dir` (default `db`)
- `calibration_dir` (default `db/calibration`)
- `calibrate` (true = refresh calibration before backtest)
- `output_dir` (default `backtests/out`)

### strategy
- `name` (currently `credit_spread`)
- `symbol` (e.g. `MNQ`, `SLV`)
- `exchange` (optional; futures default to CME)
- `right` (`PUT` or `CALL`)
- `entry_days` (3-letter names, e.g. `Tue`)
  - If omitted or empty, defaults to all weekdays.
- `dte` (0 for 0DTE)
- `otm_pct` (percent OTM for short strike)
- `width_pct` (spread width as % of spot)
- `profit_target` (fraction of credit, e.g. 0.5)
- `stop_loss` (fraction of max loss, e.g. 0.35)
- `exit_dte` (not used yet; placeholder)
- `quantity`
- `min_credit` (minimum credit to enter; units are option price)

### synthetic
- `rv_lookback` (bars)
- `rv_ewma_lambda`
- `iv_risk_premium`
- `iv_floor`
- `term_slope`
- `skew`
- `min_spread_pct`

## 0DTE behavior
- Uses a **minimum time value** equal to one session for pricing (prevents zero premium).
- If TP/SL doesn’t trigger, exits at **end-of-day**.

## Outputs
- `summary.txt` (CLI stats)
- `trades.csv` (entry/exit per trade)
- `equity_curve.csv` (equity over time)

## Reuse for live trading
The backtest engine is built around reusable components:
- **Strategy layer** emits intents
- **Execution logic** converts intents to spread pricing
- **Risk checks** apply TP/SL and exit rules

These modules will be reused in a live trading engine (future work), where market data and execution are real instead of synthetic.

## Limitations
- Synthetic options are **directional approximations**, not true bid/ask markets.
- Equity option quotes require OPRA for real data.
- Futures options bid/ask require CME options subscriptions.

## Testing notes (volatility)
- **Realized vol over time:** RV is computed per bar using EWMA of returns, so it moves through time during the backtest.
- **IV over time:** IV is synthetic (RV + static params). Calibration adjusts those params using *today’s* delayed LAST, so it improves realism for “now,” not historical regimes.
- **Persisted buckets:** Calibration records accumulate, but backtests currently use the **latest record only** (no as‑of date matching).

## Calibration (delayed LAST)
When `calibrate` is enabled (or `--calibrate` is passed), the engine will:
- Pull **delayed LAST** prices (tickType 68) across strikes/expiries.
- Fit IV parameters (floor, risk premium, skew, term slope) per expiry bucket.
- Persist results under `db/calibration/<SYMBOL>.json`.
This improves synthetic pricing without requiring OPRA/CME bid/ask.

## TODO
- Regime gating hooks
- Historical rates source
- Multi-strategy runs
- Live broker adapter
